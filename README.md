# Chef Claude - Recipe Generator

Welcome to **Chef Claude**, a React-based web application that allows users to input ingredients and get recipe suggestions powered by an AI model. Chef Claude is designed to provide users with an interactive and intuitive experience where they can add or remove ingredients, get recipe suggestions, and clear generated recipesâ€”all in a clean, user-friendly interface.

## How it Works

1. **User Input**: The user enters ingredients they have into the input field.
2. **Submit Ingredients**: As ingredients are added, the list grows. The AI will generate a recipe suggestion when the list has 4 or more ingredients.
3. **Recipe Generation**: The AI model processes the list and returns a recipe suggestion in markdown format, which is then displayed in the UI.
4. **Smooth Scroll**: When the recipe is generated, the page will automatically scroll down to the recipe section for easy viewing.
5. **Clear Recipe**: Users can clear the recipe suggestion if they want to start over or try a new set of ingredients.
